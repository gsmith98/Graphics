<p>This assignment was written in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 On a Windows 7 Ultimate (x64) machine. From what I can tell from the info panel, this means I was using Visual C++ 2015. According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1233312/finding-version-of-microsoft-c-compiler-from-command-line-for-makefiles">this post</a>, that means I was compiling with Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.XX.YYYYY for x64. I have tested that I was able to compile and run my submission by opening the .sln and using Visual Studio's "Build -> Build Solution", exactly the same way the code skeleton provided to us can be built.</p>

<p>Every function listed on <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall16/Assignments/Assignment3/">the assignment page</a> has been fully implemented up to and including the camera rotations. Additionally, I've made a ray scen that has "four walls, a floor, and a ceiling", "a table and several chairs", "3 texture mapped surfaces", and "4 point lights" for a total of 6 points. This ray file is a submission to the ray art contest, and I'm also submitting an image to the regular art contest. If there is any issue with this submission, please let me know and I can work with you to remedy it.</p>
