<p>This assignment was written in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015 On a Windows 7 Ultimate (x64) machine. From what I can tell from the info panel, this means I was using Visual C++ 2015. According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1233312/finding-version-of-microsoft-c-compiler-from-command-line-for-makefiles">this post</a>, that means I was compiling with Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.XX.YYYYY for x64. I have tested that I was able to compile and run my submission by opening the .sln and using Visual Studio's "Build -> Build Solution", exactly the same way the code skeleton provided to us can be built.</p>

<p>Every function listed on <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall16/Assignments/Assignment4/">the assignment page</a> has been fully implemented up to and including Uniform Cubic B splines for a total of 14 possible points. To use a non-linear interpolation, you may need to either comment out the ones you don't mean to use (including "break") in ParameterSamples::setCurrentValue or change all calls to it to use the method you want instead of LINEAR. If there is any issue, let me know and I will remedy it.</p>
